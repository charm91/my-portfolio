## Rendering Model

All case study pages and the portfolio page are **fully static** (SSG — prerendered at build time with no server runtime). The homepage is a client component (`"use client"`) because it uses `useSearchParams` for scroll-to-section navigation from other pages.

```
○ /               client component (Suspense + useSearchParams)
○ /portfolio      static
○ /betterhr       static
○ /kbz-bank       static
○ /unilinks       static
○ /wct            static
○ /contact-me     client component (EmailJS form)
○ /robots.txt     generated
○ /sitemap.xml    generated
```

**Important:** The `@/*` path alias resolves to `./src/*`, not the project root. `app/` is outside `src/` and is not reachable via `@/`.

---

## Features

**Homepage** — Hero, overview grid, services, portfolio cards, journey timeline, testimonials, FAQ, footer. Sections are anchor-navigable via `#id`. Cross-page navigation uses `/?scrollTo=sectionId`.

**Case studies** — Four full-length case study pages (BetterHR, KBZ Bank, UniLinks, WCT Pay). Each shares a consistent layout: page transition, scroll-reveal sections, and a `<CaseStudyAuthor />` footer block.

**Contact form** — EmailJS-powered, client-side only. Includes honeypot spam protection, a minimum fill-time check (3 seconds), and a 30-second resubmit cooldown. Validates name, email format, and message length before sending.

**SEO** — Per-page `export const metadata` with title, description, and OpenGraph data. `metadataBase` set in root layout. Auto-generated `robots.txt` and `sitemap.xml`. All identity strings sourced from `src/config/site.js`.

**Accessibility** — Skip-to-content link in root layout. All pages expose `id="main-content"`. Interactive elements use semantic HTML and ARIA labels.

**Animations** — Framer Motion scroll-reveal on all content sections (`whileInView`, fires once). Shared animation config in `src/config/caseStudy.js`. Page-entry transitions on all views.

## Local Development

**Prerequisites:** Node.js 18+, npm

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start dev server
npm run dev
# → http://localhost:3000

# Production build
npm run build

# Serve production build locally
npm run start

# Lint
npm run lint
```

---

## Environment Variables

Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and fill in your EmailJS credentials.

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

| Variable | Purpose | Where to find |
|---|---|---|
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_EMAILJS_PUBLIC_KEY` | EmailJS public key | dashboard.emailjs.com → Account |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_EMAILJS_SERVICE_ID` | EmailJS service ID | dashboard.emailjs.com → Email Services |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_EMAILJS_TEMPLATE_ID` | EmailJS template ID | dashboard.emailjs.com → Email Templates |

**Optional:**

| Variable | Purpose | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` | Canonical site URL for sitemap and robots | `https://www.nguwahaung.com/` |

If `NEXT_PUBLIC_EMAILJS_*` variables are missing at runtime, the contact form shows a configuration error message instead of attempting to send. No silent failures.

---

## Deployment

The site deploys automatically via Vercel on every push to `main`.

```
git push origin main
  → Vercel detects push
  → runs: npm run build
  → deploys static output
```

`vercel.json` contains only `{"framework": "nextjs"}`. No custom build commands, rewrites, or headers are configured.

Environment variables must be set in the Vercel project dashboard (Settings → Environment Variables). They are not committed to the repository.

---

## Maintenance Notes

**Identity and URLs** — All person identity values (`name`, `displayName`, `tagline`, `email`, `profileImage`) live in `src/config/site.js`. All page metadata references these via `SITE.name`, `SITE.displayName`, etc. Do not hardcode identity strings in page files.

**Metadata** — Each `app/*/page.jsx` exports its own `metadata` object. Titles follow the pattern `` `Page — ${SITE.displayName}` ``. The root layout (`app/layout.jsx`) sets `metadataBase` — do not remove it or OG image URLs will break.

**Case study animations** — `src/config/caseStudy.js` holds the shared animation constants (`scrollReveal`, `scrollRevealTransition`, `pageTransition`, color tokens) used by all four view files. Changing values there affects all case studies simultaneously.

**Cross-page scroll navigation** — When the Header is on a non-home page and a user clicks a nav item, it navigates to `/?scrollTo=sectionId`. The homepage reads this query param via `useSearchParams` inside a `Suspense` boundary and scrolls after a 100ms delay. This pattern is required because Next.js `useSearchParams` needs `Suspense`.

**Images** — Case study images live in `public/<case-study>/` and are referenced with absolute paths like `/betterhr/thumbnail.png`. Thumbnails used in OG images are 1488×1050 (case studies) or 1152×832 (profile-based pages). The profile photo is `/profile-photo.png`.

**Path alias** — `@/*` maps to `src/*`. Anything in `app/` must use relative imports if importing from outside `src/`.

**shadcn/ui** — Only `button` and `accordion` are installed. To add more components: `npx shadcn@latest add <component>`. Config is in `components.json`.

## Intentional Decisions

**No backend.** The site is entirely static. There is no API, database, or server runtime. EmailJS handles contact form delivery client-side.

**No CMS.** Content is hardcoded in JSX. Case study copy, testimonials, FAQ answers, and service descriptions are directly in component files. There is no content that changes frequently enough to justify a CMS.

**EmailJS over a form API route.** Avoids any server infrastructure. The tradeoff is that EmailJS credentials are exposed in the client bundle (hence `NEXT_PUBLIC_*`). This is acceptable for a contact form on a personal portfolio.

**JavaScript over TypeScript.** The project uses JSX throughout with no type annotations. This keeps the setup simple and was the original project decision.

**Static-first.** Every page that can be static is static. The homepage is the only exception (client component) due to `useSearchParams`. This keeps TTFB low and removes any Vercel function invocations.

**Vercel only.** No multi-cloud setup. Deployment configuration is minimal. Recovery means connecting the GitHub repo to a new Vercel project and setting the three EmailJS environment variables.

---

## Future Improvements

- Migrate homepage to a server component by moving `useSearchParams` to a smaller client island, removing the `"use client"` requirement from the page root
- Add TypeScript for better refactor safety as the project grows
- Replace hardcoded testimonial and FAQ content with a lightweight JS data file if content changes frequently
